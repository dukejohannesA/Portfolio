Step 4: Performance Optimization (Images & Files)


A. Compress and Optimize Images

Why: Large image files are often the biggest contributors to slow page loads. Optimizing them reduces their file size significantly without sacrificing much (or any) visible quality.


How:
- Choose the Right Format:
- Use .jpg for photographs (like your profile picture, testimonial photos).
- Use .png if you need transparency.
- Consider .webp for a modern format offering great compression (though ensure fallback for older browsers if needed, but most modern browsers support it).


Use Optimization Tools: There are many free tools:

- Online: TinyPNG / TinyJPG (handles both formats), Squoosh (by Google, more options), iLoveIMG.
- Desktop: ImageOptim (Mac), RIOT (Windows).

Action:
- Gather all your images (profile_image.jpg, about_image1.jpg to about_image8.jpg, anna_image.jpg, mark_image.jpg, dave_image.jpg).
- Upload them to a tool like TinyPNG or Squoosh.
- Download the optimized versions.
- Replace the original images in your assets folder with these smaller, optimized versions. Make sure the filenames remain exactly the same.
